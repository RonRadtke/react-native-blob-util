/**
 * Package.swift, the Swift Package Manager manifest React Native >= 0.87 uses to
 * autolink this module. CocoaPods globs its sources; the manifest enumerates
 * them, so the two drift in one direction: a new Swift file joins the pod build
 * automatically and is silently missing from the SwiftPM one. These tests tie
 * the manifest to the tree on disk so that drift fails here instead of in a
 * consumer's Xcode build.
 *
 * The React-free rule is the other half. SwiftPM cannot compile Swift and
 * C-family sources in one target, so the module is three: a React-free
 * Objective-C leaf, the Swift core, and the adapter that owns React. The leaf's
 * publicHeadersPath turns its directory into a module umbrella, and a React
 * import anywhere in it breaks that module with "'RCTBridgeModule.h' file not
 * found" - which is how this layout was arrived at. The podspec relies on the
 * same rule for public_header_files.
 *
 * Parsed as text rather than via `swift package dump-package`: these tests run
 * on every platform the module supports, and only macOS has a Swift toolchain.
